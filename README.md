# Quote
This script is an excellent opportunity to try out some of your newly learned script writing
and command line skills. The following are a few suggested changes for the daily inspirational
quote script that you can attempt on your own:
■ Change the website to your favorite quotation or sayings website, and make the
necessary changes to the quote extraction commands.
■ Try different sed and gawk commands for extracting the daily quotation.
■ Set up the script to run daily on an automated basis via cron (see Chapter 16).
■ Add a command to display the quote text fi le at certain times, such as when you
fi rst log in for the day.
Reading your daily quotes can inspire you. They may just inspire you to get out of that
next business meeting. The next chapter section helps you write a script that does just
that.
